# Examples

The examples in this directory demonstrate how to exercise different
Joshua features. If you have any comments, questions, or bug reports,
please submit them to [our support list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/joshua_support).

The decoding examples and model training examples in the subdirectories of this
directory assume you have downloaded the Fisher Spanish--English dataset, which
contains speech-recognizer output paired with English translations. This data
can be downloaded by running the [download.sh](https://github.com/joshua-decoder/joshua/blob/master/examples/download.sh) script.
