/***
 * A class for reading in rules from a Moses phrase table. Most of the conversion work is done
 * in {@link joshua.decoder.ff.tm.format.PhraseFormatReader}. This includes prepending every
 * rule with a nonterminal, so that the phrase-based decoder can assume the same hypergraph
 * format as the hierarchical decoder (by pretending to be a strictly left-branching grammar and
 * dispensing with the notion of coverage spans). However, prepending the nonterminals means all
 * the alignments are off by 1. We do not want to fix those when reading in due to the expense,
 * so instead we use this rule which adjust the alignments on the fly.
 * 
 * Also, we only convert the Moses dense features on the fly, via this class.
 * 
 * TODO: this class should also be responsible for prepending the nonterminals.
