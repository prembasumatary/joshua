/**
 * This feature is fired when an out-of-vocabulary word (with respect to the translation model) is
 * entered into the chart. OOVs work in the following manner: for each word in the input that is OOV
 * with respect to the translation model, we create a rule that pushes that word through
 * untranslated (the suffix "_OOV" can optionally be appended according to the runtime parameter
 * "mark-oovs") . These rules are all stored in a grammar whose owner is "oov". The OOV feature
 * function template then fires the "OOVPenalty" feature whenever it is asked to score an OOV rule.
