/**
 * This class defines Joshua's feature function interface, for both sparse and
 * dense features. It is immediately inherited by StatelessFF and StatefulFF,
 * which provide functionality common to stateless and stateful features,
 * respectively. Any feature implementation should extend those classes, and not
 * this one. The distinction between stateless and stateful features is somewhat
 * narrow: all features have the opportunity to return an instance of a
 * {@link DPState} object, and stateless ones just return null.
 * 
 * Features in Joshua work like templates. Each feature function defines any
 * number of actual features, which are associated with weights. The task of the
 * feature function is to compute the features that are fired in different
 * circumstances and then return the inner product of those features with the
 * weight vector. Feature functions can also produce estimates of their future
 * cost (via {@link estimateCost()}); these values are not used in computing the
 * score, but are only used for sorting rules during cube pruning. The
 * individual features produced by each template should have globally unique
 * names; a good convention is to prefix each feature with the name of the
 * template that produced it.
 * 
 * Joshua does not retain individual feature values while decoding, since this
 * requires keeping a sparse feature vector along every hyperedge, which can be
 * expensive. Instead, it computes only the weighted cost of each edge. If the
 * individual feature values are requested, the feature functions are replayed
 * in post-processing, say during k-best list extraction. This is implemented in
 * a generic way by passing an {@link Accumulator} object to the compute()
 * function. During decoding, the accumulator simply sums weighted features in a
 * scalar. During k-best extraction, when individual feature values are needed,
 * a {@link FeatureAccumulator} is used to retain the individual values.
